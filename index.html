        <h3>Two unordered facts about Gojo</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Limitless Cursed Technique: Gojo Satoru possesses the powerful
            "Limitless" cursed technique, which is derived from the Gojo family.
            This technique grants him control over space at an atomic level,
            allowing him to manipulate distances and create a barrier that stops
            any physical attacks. One of the most notable aspects of this
            technique is "Infinity," which creates an infinite distance between
            Gojo and any attack, effectively making him untouchable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Six Eyes: Gojo's unique ability, known as the "Six Eyes," greatly
            enhances his perception and usage of cursed energy. The Six Eyes
            provide him with extraordinary vision, allowing him to see cursed
            energy with incredible detail and precision. This ability also
            reduces the amount of cursed energy he uses, making him more
            efficient in battle. The combination of the Limitless technique and
            the Six Eyes makes Gojo one of the most powerful and formidable
            sorcerers in the "Jujutsu Kaisen" series.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two ordered facts about Sukuna</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            King of Curses: Ryomen Sukuna, also known simply as Sukuna, is a
            legendary cursed spirit referred to as the "King of Curses." He was
            once a human sorcerer who lived over a thousand years ago, known for
            his immense power and cruelty. After his death, Sukuna's power was
            so great that his body could not be completely destroyed, leading to
            his remains being divided into 20 indestructible fingers that became
            powerful cursed objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Possession of Yuji Itadori: In the "Jujutsu Kaisen" series, Sukuna's
            influence resurfaces when Yuji Itadori consumes one of Sukuna's
            fingers, becoming his vessel. Despite Sukuna's attempts to take
            control of Yuji's body, Yuji manages to suppress Sukuna's influence
            most of the time. However, when Sukuna does take over, his power and
            abilities become accessible, making Yuji incredibly formidable but
            also posing a significant threat to those around him.
